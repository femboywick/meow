# upgrade path

### collectable upgrades
each area will contain 5[^note] upgrade items (maybe circuits). after collecting 5 upgrade items, the player will be able to unlock an upgrade, which will benefit their platforming. 
the idea is that these are optional, but if the player *wants* to persue the harder characters, they must collect some (if not all) upgrades to be able to get the items necessary.
only one upgrade can be applied at a time, unless the player has an upgrade to unlock more upgrades.

[^note]: like everything else, subject to change lol

#### (potential) list of upgrades
- extended/double jump (sonic toe beans)
- spinning tail to glide {helicopter style} (name?)
- [terraria-style grappling hooks](#grappling-hook) {if its not too hard lol} (name?)
-
- multiple upgrade slots (name?)

##### grappling hook
potentially, we could have it so the grappling hook could only work on certain surfaces, limiting its usecases. this needs to be further thought about, but that will come later.
