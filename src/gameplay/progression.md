# progression

### unlocking areas
since the player will unlock areas to explore via progressing their relationships, if it takes too long for them to unlock an area, they may run out of content to explore/platform in the starting area. there are two options to solve this:
- unlock another house quick
- put more content in starting area

#### unlocking the city
we will have two entrances for the city, the sewers and the card. the sewers will be unlocked by dating a character in the megabuilding, whilst the card will be unlocked by dating a character in the city. the sewers will probably cause the player to become stinky, meaning theyd have to shower. this can be explored more later.
