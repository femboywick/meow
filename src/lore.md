# general lore

## power and cars
all the fossil fuels have ran out, so gas-powered cars are all but gone now. (maybe there are a few lying around for aesthetic). since lithium has almost run out and become very expensive, electric cars with batteries arent worth the cost. there are a couple options for this post-gas and post-lithium world:
- thorium reactors
- hydrogen 

only the rich in the city can afford these expensive cars, so its rare to find them anywhere else. however, there may potentially be powered dirt bikes or other small forms of transport in the container slums and docks.

robots obviously cant have much battery power, so they rely on whichever the dominant power source is. some robots may have cables plugged into them constantly, particular those in retail (trolley-like).

## cat lore
the cat will probably be a cyborg, born with missing body parts, whose original owner augmented them. these cybernetic parts can be upgraded (see [upgrade path](./gameplay/upgrades.md))
